# ThinkPython-exercises
This repository contains all of the code examples from the book, organized by chapter and topic. I hope that these code examples will be useful for students who are working through the book and want to see the examples in action.

To get started, simply navigate to the folder corresponding to the chapter you are working on and find the code example you are looking for. Each code example is self-contained and can be run on its own.

I hope that these code examples will be a helpful resource for students as they work through the book. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
